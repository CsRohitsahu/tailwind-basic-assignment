          <b class="text-2xl">His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth</b>
          writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents’ garage in 1976,
          was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in
          1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the
          world’s most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform
          seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones,
          tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus
          belongs in the pantheon of America’s great innovators, along with
          Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a
          saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will
          remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.

        <div class="w-5/12 m-2 text-left"><p>One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of
            the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people.
            “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart people I work
            with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they
            were truly feeling brutalized. But they don’t.” Then he paused for a
            few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some amazing
            things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the
            past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative
            company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple
            Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention
            every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
            surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been
            inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four
            children. </p></div>
